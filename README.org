* Stippling post-processing effect in Unity
This repository contains a work-in-progress post processing effect in Unity that
creates a "stippled" look, as if the image was just drawn with black dots. It's
sort-of a pointillism effect, sort-of digital half-toning, and very much a work
in progress, so the repository is a little bit messy. This is what it looks like
as a gif (though cramming it into a gif destroys the effect a bit):

The algorithm is based on the paper [[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00371-018-1541-7][Incremental Voronoi sets for instant
stippling]] by Lei Ma, Yanyun Chen, Yinling Qian & Hanqiu Sun. 

In order to get this to work, you have to "bake" so-called Instant Voronoi Sets
beforehand. Two such sets are included in this repository, and you can find the
generator I made for these sets [[https://github.com/OskarSigvardsson/incremental-voronoi-sets][here]].
